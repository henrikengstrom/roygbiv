*** GETTING STARTED GUIDE

The aim of this project is to build a ray tracer in Scala backed by the Akka framework.
It is solely a hobby project and the progress might be slow depending on the real work load of the authors.
It's being developed by two Swedish geeks from which one is reachable on Twitter with the tag @h3nk3
Please feel free to contact us for any inquiries.

The name of the system is two folded in that it, of course, represents the colors of the rainbow and colors is what
ray tracing is all about, but also that Roygbiv happens to be the name of a fantastic song by the eminent group Boards of Canada:

*** REQUIRED SOFTWARE

GIT
SBT 0.10.1 (see https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki for installation, getting started, etc)
An idea that you feel confortable with (this guide will use IntelliJ IDEA)

*** INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Download code from Git into a local directory
> git clone git@github.com:henrikengstrom/roygbiv.git

2. Run SBT
> sbt

After some intial logging you should see something like this:
[info] Set current project to default-77212f (in build file:/code/roygbiv/)
> 

This means you are good to go!
Test to compile the system with:
> compile

3. Generate IntelliJ IDEA files from SBT
While in SBT enter the following:
> gen-idea

There might be a couple of warnings but you can disregard these.
Wait until you can see the SBT prompt again.
You should now have a .idea and a .idea_modules file in your project.
Open IDEA and select the "roygbiv" folder where you have downloaded the project.

Before you can handle Scala in IDEA you must download the Scala plugin (IntelliJ IDEA -> Preferences... -> Plugins -> Scala)
While you're at it you might as well download the SBT plugin so that you can run SBT from inside the best IDE out there :-)

After importing the project you may want to "clean up" the project settings.
- Inside the IDEA right-click the "roygbiv" and select Open Module Settings.
- In the sources tab the following source folders should be available:
  src/main/scala
  src/main/config
- In the sources tab the following test folders should be available:
  src/test/scala

NOTE:
Please make sure that the IDEA related files are not pushed into the repository as they are client specific!
Maybe it goes without writing but if the SBT project is updated, e.g. with new dependencies, you must re-generate your IDEA files again. 

*** RUNNING THE SYSTEM

To run the system from inside IDEA you do the following:
1. Run -> Edit Configurations
2. Click the + sign and add Application
3. Enter the following information:
   Name: "roygbiv"
   Main class: akka.kernel.Main
   VM parameters: <your_project_on_disk>/src/main/config/akka.conf
   Working directory:
   Use classpath and JDK from project: roygbiv
   Before launch: Select SBT and "compile" as target
4. Click OK

Once you have followed the instructions above you can run the system by clicking the green "arrow" or Run->Run...->"roygbiv"

Should you get the following exception while running "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: microkernel-server.xml not found!"
this simply means that the microkernel-server.xml has not been moved to the target folder. A Build->Make should solve this issue.

To make sure the system is running the following URL is handy:
http://localhost:9898/roygbiv/ping
